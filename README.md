CREATE DEV ACC ON FIREBASE DB AND REMOVE ACCES TO PROD FROM LOCALHOST
 - done: new app created inside todo-app project - 'todo-gradient-dev'; Access to API granted only via my public API address
 - don't forget to exclude firebase.js file from pull request.



Jest for tests: 
  - test login page
  - test forgot password page
  - test registration page
  - test adding new todo
  - test completing todo
  - test removing todo
  - test activating todo
  - test clear completed button
  - test filtering

Create new git branch and a pull request ;

Add sections for todos
 - test sorting by section;

Add a better error handling
- when server throws 403 . To replicate the error - restrict API acces from localhost
- add error to Promises generated by Firebase SDK (login/register/reset password functions)
